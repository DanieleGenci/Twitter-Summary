DESCRIPTION
===========

This corpus consists of a total of 51,879,318 tweet IDs along with the
corresponding user screen names.  All tweets have to be processed by the FSD
system in the order that they appear in the tweet_ids file.  All the tweets
were obtained from Twitter's streaming API.  For evaluating FSD system
performance, 3034 tweets were tagged as being on-topic for one of 27 topics
(described below).  The format of relevance_judgments file is

tweet_id topic_id

tweet_id corresponds to one of the tweets in the tweets_ids file.  topic_id
identifies the topic that the tweet belongs to.  The first tweet in
relevance_judgments with a certain topic_id is the first story, and the rest
are non-first stories.

KNOWN ISSUES
============
The tweet_ids file may appear unsorted.  This is because when we encounter a
retweet, we take the original tweet's ID, not the retweet's ID.

Related to the previous point, some tweet IDs may appear more than once in
tweet_ids (e.g., if we have two tweets that retweet the same original tweet).

In the labeling process, topic 3 had a missed first story:
89497819701968897
This is NOT corrected in the relevance_judgments file (the first story in
relevance_judgments for topic 3 is still 89498478216089601).  Taking the
corrected first story into account will improve the absolute performance of FSD
systems, but it is highly unlikely that it will change their ranking.
